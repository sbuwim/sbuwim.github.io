Women in Mathematics (WiM) is a registered student organization at Stony Brook University whose purpose is to create a community in which women and others of marginalized identities can thrive in their mathematical endeavors, and to promote equitable opportunity and treatment of all across the mathematical sciences. We are also an official student chapter of the [Association for Women in Mathematics](https://awm-math.org/) (AWM).

We hold lectures and panels, social gatherings, arts and crafts outreach events, and collaborations with other organizations. 

Anyone is welcome to come to our events or to join our club, regardless of major or gender identity.
