#### When and where are meetings held?

We typically meet every other Tuesday from 7 â€“ 8 PM, and our full schedule can be found [here](/schedule/). Our meetings are held in room P-131 of the Math Tower, which (for reference) is semi-attached to the physics building. After going in through the main entrance which faces the physics building, the first door immediately on the left leads into P-131. It's as easy as that.

Occasionally, we may hold our general body meetings or special events outside of our normal meeting time and place, so make sure to check back at either this site or our social media!

#### How can I find out more about meetings?

Meeting details will be posted on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/{{ site.instagram_id }}/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/{{ site.discord_inv }}), as well as announced over the [Math Club mailing list](https://you.stonybrook.edu/mathclub/contact-us/). Information will be posted to [SB Engaged](https://stonybrook.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/awmstudentchapter)/Corq as well, but understand that everything published there must be manually approved by someone in a compliance office, so things can take some time to update.

#### Am I allowed to attend a meeting if I am not a woman, or a member?

Yes! Our meetings are always open to everyone, regardless of gender identity or membership status. We hope to see you there!

#### How do I become a member?

As per our [constitution](/assets/pdf/AWM_Constitution_Spring_2023.pdf), a member is defined as anyone who has attended our events at least once. Pretty simple!
